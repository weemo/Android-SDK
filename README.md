# Weemo Android SDK and SDK Helper

This repository contains the Weemo Android SDK. More information about Weemo SDKs can be found at [http://www.weemo.com/](http://www.weemo.com/)


## Weemo Android SDK

The use cases have been minimized in order to reduce the integration effort while creating a functional model for the POC that covers most of the use cases for audio and video during 1:1 calls.
Basic implemented functions into this example are: 

- Initialization and Cloud authentification
- Send or Receive a call by UID  
- Stop or Start video
- Mute or Unmute audio
- Support Android multi-tasking 

For implementation details, please refer to the [project wiki](https://github.com/weemo/Android-SDK/wiki) and to the detailed [API Reference](http://docs.weemo.com/sdk/android/) documentation.
